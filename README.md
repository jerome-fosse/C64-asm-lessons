# Commodore 64 projets
Some small projects I have written in my attempt to learn assembler for the Commodore 64.

## 1. Pretty Hello World
Yes it's an hello world but it does a little more than simply writting theses famous words to the screen. Letters are flashing and you have to hit the Esc key to end the program.

What I have learn with this code :
- Manipulate the CPU register
- Using some simple loops
- Writting some characters to the screen
- managing colors
- check for keyboard input
- I also used irq for the first time.
