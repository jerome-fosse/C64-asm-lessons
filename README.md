# Commodore 64 projets
Some small projects I have written in my attempt to learn assembler for the Commodore 64.

## 1. Pretty Hello World
Yes it's a hello world but it does a little more than simply writting these famous words to the screen. Letters are flashing and you have to hit the Esc key to end the program.

What I have learned with this code :
- Manipulate the CPU register
- Using some simple loops
- Writting some characters to the screen
- managing colors
- check keyboard input
- I also used irq for the first time.
